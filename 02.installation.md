# Installation

To integrate Transform2D in your Unity project:
* Open your Unity project.
* Access the Package Manager through the Window menu.
* In the Package Manager's left pane, navigate to `My Assets`. You should find the `Transform2D` package listed there.
* Add the package to your project.
* The package will then appear in your project's `Assets` folder as `tools.bnop.transform2d`, where it must remain for the plugin to function.
* Close the Package Manager.
* Open the Transform2D panel by selecting `Tools → Transform2D → Open Transform2D` from the main menu. For optimal workflow, dock this panel into your preferred Unity layout.

## Performance and default workflow implications
Transform2D operates only at design time with a negligible performance footprint and will not affect runtime performance at all. It works alongside Unity's default Transform component without overriding it.

### Deactivating Transform2D
For any reason, you can temporarily disable all plugin operations without closing the panel by deselecting Tools → Transform2D → Enable Transform2D.
