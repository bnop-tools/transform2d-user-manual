## Performance Notes

Transform2D is a **design-time-only** tool with a **negligible performance** **footprint** and zero runtime overhead. It works alongside Unity's Transform component without overriding it, ensuring compatibility with other plugins and preserving your standard workflows.

## Deactivation

For any reason, **to temporarily disable:** Deselect `Tools → Transform2D → Enable Transform2D`
