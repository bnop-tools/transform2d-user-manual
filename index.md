# Welcome to Transform2D ✨

**Transform2D** is a powerful editor extension that augments Unity’s limited Transform interface with essential features commonly found in standard design software.

With Transform2D, you can:

- **Position, resize, and rotate** objects from any anchor point.
- Directly **set width/height** instead of calculating scale values.
- Work with single objects or **groups**, using advanced **alignment** and **distribution** tools.
- Switch between **local** and **global** space for all transformations.
- Use **world units** or **pixels** for all transformations, and achieve pixel-perfect results.
- Create and snap to **Guides** for structured, consistent layouts.
