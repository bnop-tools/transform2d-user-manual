# Known Limitations

## General

- **Tiled and Sliced sprites**: Bounds detection is not currently supported.
- **UI Elements**: The UI Canvas and its components are not supported, as they use Unity's dedicated layout system.

## Group Selection

- Mixed selection of objects and their parents currently not supported.

## Unsupported Components

The following components are not supported for bounds detection:

- `CustomCollider2D`, `CompositeCollider2D`, and `TileMapCollider2D`
- The auto-tiling feature of `BoxCollider2D` and `PolygonCollider2D`
- All 3D Collider types (e.g., `BoxCollider`, `SphereCollider`)

Limited Support:

`CircleCollider2D` and `CapsuleCollider2D`: While functional, their bounds may be calculated inaccurately if they are children of a parent object that has been rotated or scaled non-uniformly.
