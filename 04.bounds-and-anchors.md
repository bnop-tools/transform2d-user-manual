# Using Game Object Bounds and Anchors

Unity's built-in Transform component is unaware of object bounds and is limited to transforming objects around their origin point—an arbitrary reference that often bears no relation to your game object's visual or logical boundaries. Plus, you can only scale, not set actual dimensions. These restrictions can make aligning, resizing, or positioning objects by their edges incredibly frustrating.

Transform2D fixes this by detecting your game object's **bounds** and allowing **dynamic transformation anchor points**. It derives these bounds from **SpriteRenderer** or **Collider2D** components, and also supports **Camera** and **TextMeshPro**. This makes common tasks intuitive—positioning an object to the right of another or resizing from its bottom edge becomes as simple as selecting the anchor point, while setting precise dimensions is as straightforward as entering width and height values.

## Setting the Transform Anchor

Use the **Transform Anchor Grid** to select anchor points on the object's bounds (corners and centers) for position, size, scale, and rotation.

**Tip!** It's also handy for just quickly viewing the coordinates of your game object's bounds.

## Setting Game Object Bounds

Transform2D supports various bounds sources to fit your specific needs, whether you're positioning objects visually, logically, or even aligning to a Camera's edge.

Use the bounds selector to pick your preferred bounds source:

- **Collider2D**: Uses bounds from a Collider2D component, ideal for referencing logical or physical boundaries. If multiple colliders exist, it uses the first one.
- **SpriteRenderer**: Uses sprite asset bounds from the SpriteRenderer component, perfect for referencing visual boundaries.
- **No Bounds**: Reverts to Unity's default **Transform** behavior. No bounds are detected, width and height are set to **0**, and the anchor grid is disabled. All transformations use the game object's origin point.

If the selected source isn't available on the current game object, Transform2D temporarily falls back on another source in this priority: **Collider2D → Sprite Renderer → No Bounds**. For example, if you select Sprite Renderer but the component is missing, Transform2D will use Collider2D if it's available; otherwise, it defaults to Transform Origin.

## Using Camera and Text bounds

Transform2D offers specialized support for **Camera** and non-UI **TextMeshPro (TMP)** game objects. This allows for precise placement, such as positioning a collider just outside a camera's edge or aligning TMP objects with exact margins, without needing a UI Canvas.

When a game object includes a Camera or TextMeshPro component, Transform2D automatically uses that component as its bounds source, overriding other selections. A notification will appear to confirm this. If both are present, the Camera component takes precedence.
